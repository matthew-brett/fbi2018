<p>Neuroimaging is a highly technical field, on the border of neuroscience and
computation.</p>

<p>This is a risk of false findings.</p>

<h2 id="the-reproducibility-crisis">The reproducibility crisis</h2>

<p>Many of us are familiar with the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">replication
crisis</a>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to trace when the issue of replication started to enter
discussion in the mainstream, but one landmark was (missing reference).
Begley and Ellis were scientists at Amgen - a drug company. They tried to
reproduce findings from 53 “landmark” studies in hematological oncology -
blood cancer.  They tried fairly hard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… when findings could not be reproduced, an attempt was made to contact
the original authors, discuss the discrepant findings, exchange reagents and
repeat experiments under the authors’ direction, occasionally even in the
laboratory of the original investigator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of 53 studies, only 6 replicated (11%).</p>

<p>They detected a difference between the working process of the labs that
generated the findings that replicated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In studies for which findings could be reproduced, authors had paid close
attention to controls, reagents, investigator bias and describing the
complete data set. For results that could not be reproduced, however, data
were not routinely analysed by investigators blinded to the experimental
versus control groups. Investigators frequently presented the results of one
experiment, such as a single Western-blot analysis. They sometimes said they
presented specific experiments that supported their underlying hypothesis,
but that were not reflective of the entire data set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The replication rate for these studies seemed to be about 11%, but it can be a
lot worse.  When we look back at early results in genetics, with the benefit
of hindsight from newer, larger genetic studies, the replication rate appears
to be in the region of 2% <a href="#ioannidis2011false">(Ioannidis, Tarone, &amp; McLaughlin, 2011)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-rate-of-false-findings">The rate of false findings</h2>

<p>There is an increased risk of false findings for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>small sample size (low power);</li>
  <li>small effect size (low power);</li>
  <li>large number of tests (analysis bias);</li>
  <li>greater flexibility in analysis (analysis bias);</li>
  <li>greater financial interests (analysis bias);</li>
  <li>larger numbers of groups studying same effects (publication bias);</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="false-findings-in-neuroimaging">False findings in neuroimaging</h2>

<p>Nancy Kanwisher is one of the most important and influential researchers in
functional MRI, particularly of the visual system.</p>

<p>She left the following comment on <a href="http://www.danielbor.com/dilemma-weak-neuroimaging">Daniel Bor’s 2013 blog
post</a> on “The Dilemma of
Weak Neuroimaging Papers”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have occasionally asked respected colleagues what percent of published
neuroimaging findings they think would replicate, and the answer is
generally very depressing. My own guess is <strong>way</strong> less than 50%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is more discussion of this comment attached to the blog post.</p>

<h2 id="my-straw-poll">My straw poll</h2>

<p>After Kanwisher’s post, I took to asking the following question, to colleagues
running neuroimaging labs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us say you took a random sample of papers using functional MRI over the
last five years. For each study in the sample, you repeated the same
experiment.  What proportion of your repeat experiments would substantially
replicate the main findings of the original paper?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answers ranged from 5% to 50%.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-false-findings-get-through">How do false findings get through?</h2>

<p>There are many factors in neuroimaging that make us more prone to getting the
answer wrong (see above).  Among them, is our approach to computing - we often
do not take it seriously.  Here are some strong comments from an eminent
statistician and advocate of <em>reproducible research</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my own experience, error is ubiquitous in scientific computing, and one
needs to work very diligently and energetically to eliminate it. One needs a
very clear idea of what has been done in order to know where to look for
likely sources of error. I often cannot really be sure what a student or
colleague has done from his/her own presentation, and in fact often his/her
description does not agree with my own understanding of what has been done,
once I look carefully at the scripts. Actually, I find that researchers
quite generally forget what they have done and misrepresent their
computations.</p>

  <p>Computing results are now being presented in a very loose, “breezy” way—in
journal articles, in conferences, and in books. All too often one simply
takes computations at face value. This is spectacularly against the evidence
of my own experience. I would much rather that at talks and in referee
reports, the possibility of such error were seriously examined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#donoho2010invitation">(Donoho, 2010)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In stark contrast to the sciences relying on deduction or empiricism,
computational science is far less visibly concerned with the ubiquity of
error. At conferences and in publications, it’s now completely acceptable
for a researcher to simply say, “here is what I did, and here are my
results.” Presenters devote almost no time to explaining why the audience
should believe that they found and corrected errors in their computations.
The presentation’s core isn’t about the struggle to root out error — as it
would be in mature fields — but is instead a sales pitch: an enthusiastic
presentation of ideas and a breezy demo of an implementation. Computational
science has nothing like the elaborate mechanisms of formal proof in
mathematics or meta-analysis in empirical science. Many users of scientific
computing aren’t even trying to follow a systematic, rigorous discipline
that would in principle allow others to verify the claims they make. How
dare we imagine that computational science, as routinely practiced, is
reliable!</p>

<h2 id="garbage-in-gospel-out">Garbage in, gospel out</h2>

<p>Neuroimaging is complicated and confusing.  You will have to use ideas from
many different fields, including some you are trained in, such as psychology,
and neuroscience, and others that you probably are not trained in, such as
linear algebra, signal and image processing.  You will likely be using rather
old-fashioned and complicated software that has grown organically with the
field, and presents familiar ideas in unfamiliar ways.</p>

<p>If you are not careful, you will succumb to “garbage in, gospel out”.  The
process of analyzing the data becomes so complicated that you can’t criticize
it any more.  You either object, and risk looking stupid and displeasing your
masters, or give in, and accept that it’s all correct, even though it would be
very hard to check.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-by-building">Understanding by building</h2>

<p>Some of you will have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>, a famous physicist and teacher.</p>

<p>When he died, in 1988, he had this written on his blackboard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a copy of the original photo
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dDIEBrnydU4/U1KyfconeZI/AAAAAAAARYk/bDhvfLteMjU/s1600/RF.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>My desire is to give you an idea of what neuroimaging data looks like, and how
you might build very basic versions of the processing you need.  If all the
servers in the world go down, and you don’t have your neuroimaging software
any more, you should think “wow, that’s a bummer, but now I can build what I
need myself”.</p>
