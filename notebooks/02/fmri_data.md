# FMRI data

In which we cover the nature of images, and brain images, in particular.

For these pages, you will need to download the following files:

* [ds114 structural image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data/ds114_sub009_highres.nii).
* [ds114 FMRI image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data/ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii).
* [ds114 stimulus file]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data/ds114_sub009_t2r1_cond.txt).

You will also need the `nibabel` library.  Please follow the instructions on
[installing nibabel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link install_nibabel.md %})

In the pages that come next, you will be using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

At the top of each page, you will see a "Download" link, and an "Interact"
link.

If you don't want to run anything on your own laptop, and you don't mind
things being a bit slow, you can click on the "Interact" link, and our friends
at [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) kindly spin up a computer somewhere in the
cloud, to run the code.

Otherwise, please consider downloading the Notebook to your desktop, and then
running the Jupyter Notebook.  If you're on Windows, you can press the start
key and type "Jupyter", then select "Jupyter Notebook" and run that.
