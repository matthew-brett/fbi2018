# Why Python?

So far you have been learning the MATLAB programming language, but here I'm
using the Python programming language.

There is some background on Python in [the
tools page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tools.md %}).

The main reason I am doing this is - I can't build a site like this for
MATLAB, or at least, I don't know how to.  As far as I know, the tools that I
am using here, do not exist in an easily accessible form, for MATLAB.  This is
partly because Python has a [much larger
community](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python)
than MATLAB does, and therefore, the tools develop faster.
