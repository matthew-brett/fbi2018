# Tools

These notes use the [Python](https://python.org) programming language, and its
libraries, including [Numpy](https://numpy.org/numpy) for handling array data,
and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plotting.  Python is a general
programming language that is excellent for teaching, but also for serious
coding in business and academia.

We will be using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) for combining
code and text in a web browser.

We will also use [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel) for loading and saving
neuroimaging image formats.

To get set up for the class, see [the setup instructions](setup)
